# Overleaf Summaries
This repository contains summaries of the the content I learned in classes taken at UCI. 
Most of these summaries will pertain to mathematics and physics and will most likely be written in haste resulting in badly written work. 
Through this repo, I hope other people, whether peer or stranger, can suggest useful revisions to my work.
